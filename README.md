# Kaizo Editon: A tougher modification of Minecraft

THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL MINECRAFT PRODUCT. NOT APPROVED BY OR ASSOCIATED WITH MOJANG OR MICROSOFT.

# Info

You will need a paid minecraft account to play this (no cracked), and no, there are not plans to make this cracked in anyway. [Minecraft Store](www.minecraft.net/store/minecraft-java-bedrock-edition-pc)

Bedrock Edition is currently unsupported.

This is not meant to be fair, but also not so unfair its not fun (except extreme), create a suggestion [here](https://kaizoedition.nhforums.net/suggestions/) if you want to give a idea or if you want something to be more balenced.

If you need info on any of the new recipes or changes, they will be located in the [wiki](https://github.com/archerv123456/minecraft-kaizo-editon-public/wiki) when it is done.

When setting up a server, make sure that hardcore is true, you can leave it false, but this is meant to be played on hardcore.

Also the port of the server is 25565, to use it without port fowarding, i personally use [playit](https://playit.gg), but you can use whatever is needed.

[Kaizo Edition Discord](https://discord.com/invite/aG4a2vEEvu) You must be 13+

You can use chat colors in chat, [Here](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/minecraft-color-codes/) is where you can find the color codes, they do start with ยง

# Installation

Go to one of the [releases](https://github.com/archerv123456/minecraft-kaizo-editon-public/releases) and download either the jar ([java 18 recommend](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk18-archive-downloads.html)) or the exe for windows.

After installing, start it, and click the install button if the install location was auto set. Make sure you make the minecraft launcher is closed while its installing.

Once its done installing, open up the minecraft launcher, and if all went well it should be there.

## Server Hosing Guide

To host a server, its recommended you run it from a command line (Command Prompt, whatever) so you can see the logs and use commands.

the version of java is recommended to be Java 18
