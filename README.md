I am in no way affiliated with Mojang or their affiliates, they own Minecraft and its source code. None of this would be possible without them.


# Info

You will need a paid minecraft account to play this (no cracked), and no, there are not plans to make this cracked in anyway.

Bedrock Edition is currently unsupported.

This is not meant to be fair, but also not so unfair its not fun (except hardMode), create an issue if you want to give a suggestion if you want something to be more balenced.
